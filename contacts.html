				<h3>Roots and Culture</h3>

		<section class="section section-dark">
			<p>Our forefathers fought for independence in hopes of redeeming our land and restoring our culture,despite all this the aftermath of the colonial period is still here with us.We have also gone to an extent of developing western cultures that are poison to our used-to-be well natured society.Generations after generations embrace the culture and practise it to their maximum</p>
			<p>Some of the progressive colonial actions are oppression of the poor.Some rich employers have been reported to the court of law for oppression and exploitation of their employees,but the cases disappear as soon as they are presented in court.Others have gone to an extent of exposing their employees to harsh working conditions.A man once collapsed and died in a mining site due to a weak ladder falling apart and that was the end of his story,very sad.Some local industries also dispose waste material that harm the lives of poor innocent people who cannot fight for their right.</p>
			<p>Land grabbing has also been a major issue especially to people who cannot defend themselves.We have had cases of people being killed because they refused to surrender their property.People with many hectares of land have been questioned in the court of law of the ownership of their properties but the justice system is so corrupt that after a lump some of money the case is dismissed leaving more people miserable. </p>
			<p>The role of women in the society is another issue,women are expected to be nothing but child bearers and home makers.If you ask a succesful woman how she got to achieve what she has now,she will tell you of how she had to work twice as hard as the man in the same path.They are also judgement that comes with being a succesful woman.They are normally called disrespectful and hard headed in some of our communities.Widows are also denied the right to inherit their deceased spouses properties just because they are women.The number of women in our parliament is low as compared to the number of men  thus if the bills discussed are in regards to gender equality,the chances of such bills being passed amount to zero </p>
			<p>Some assimilated cultures are not that progressive for example dressing code.Yes we used to have so many people coping the westeners style of dressing but still we are able to witness people adorning themselves in traditional clothing especially when attending cultural events.We have also witnessed Ankara as a common piece of dressing especially to couples and families.Some cultures like the Maasai and the turkana people have been maintaining their cultural way of dressing.</p>
			<p>Change is inevitable but culture is something that was there during our forefathers days and we should treasure every aspect of it.Events like cultural days can be organized and different cultures can interact and share what the communities seem to have forgotten.On the poor being exploited and oppressed,the government and the labour society should step in and ensure that the workers are taken care of.The justice system should also step in and deliver justice to all those who seek it.To the women who fight in day in day out for equality kudos,more women should be motivated to join this fulfilling battle</p>
			<p>In conclusion,we are all human,beneath the skin we are all equal and the same.We should embrace one another and work together,other external cultures should not separate us. </p>
