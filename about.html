			<p>Covid 19 has robbed us of so many key activities,one being the right to enjoy education.Many schools closed with an anticipation of resuming after three months but it has been six months since schools were closed and the hope to resuming school this year is long forgotten.Students are now at home roaming around with a small population affording to engage in online studies.With the amount of peer pressure that is out there ,they all need some tips to be able to 'survive' during this period so that they can join school again in January.One,they should understand their purpose and what drives them or motivates them as a student.People go to school for different reasons but I believe that there is that one common goal among a higher percentage of students and that is to create a strong and better foundation for themselves,so if they set their goals and targets right there is nothing that can stop them in achieving what they want.</p>
			<p>Peer pressure is an enemy of progress,people always want to fit in and some will go to an extent of completely changing their character and behaviour so as to be "cool" .In the generation that we are in,we have cleary witnessed the aftermath of hanging out with the wrong crowd.Bullets,unwanted pregnancy,diseases are just some of the consequences but one major unmentioned issue is the mental torture that one goes through after taking a wrong turn.Students should keep the right company,they associate with the people who want to build them and by doing this we are assurred that a good future lies ahead. </p>
			<p>During this time although physical interaction has become really hard,its time to be creative and explore technology to the fullest.Student can create online communities whereby they can form study groups in which can revise their course work and also challenge one another and explore more.They can also be a huge help in managing of covid 19 by forming groups that will aim at creating awareness and also aid in distributing food and other neccessities to the less fortunate people in the community. </p>
			<p>Talent is a gift  that can change somebody's life ,students can engage in artwork,beadwork,pottery and knitting.I know of a form three student who earns around three thousand a week from knitting.They can also do graffiti and potraits to help create awareness of covid 19 all around the community.</p>
			<p>One of the most underatted activity is exercising,I remember back in high school how we used to complain everytime during PE lessons because we did not want to exercise instead we wanted to take a forty minutes power nap.I did not see the importance of the forced exercising routine until some years later when we went hiking and let's say one of our group member had to be carried all the way home.Practising a healthy exercise routine is very important,it keeps the mind fresh and the body very productive.For good results and brain development student should aim to atleast do one exercise per day.</p>
			<p>The community should also aim at supporting the students.Over the past months the number of pregnancy has risen to a shocking number,majority of th victims are raped in silence and the community has done nothing concrete about it.I remember as a kid we were usually warned about a certain man who use to rape young girls and we would see him approaching our direction and immmediately run for our life.I never understood why they could not report him to the police romours had it that he was in and out if jail for that same reason countless times.In my opinion he should have stayed in forever.This is one of the cases that the community tolerates,some individual fear reporting the person citing that some have connection in the justice depaertment who can bail them out.What a world! but thanks to the activits and organization that are here to fight for human rights.No one should suffer in silence and also the community should aim to support one another especially the upcoming generation because they are the future and caretakers of tomorrow. </p>
			<p>In conclusion,an investment in knowledge pays the best interest,education is the passport to the future,for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.In order to experience a better future,one must aim to create a good foundation for it.</p>
