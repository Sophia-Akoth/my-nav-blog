				<h3>Beliefs and Vision</h3>
		</div>
		<section class="section section-dark">
			<p>Majority of people are normally tied to their current situation and the belief that they cannot achieve or excel beyond what they vision.Growing up I remember all the dreams that I had as a kid to be a Doctor,Engineer,Lawyer or Architect.The key thing that kept ringing in my mind is the amount of fee that was to be paid if I was to pursue such careers and I suddenly lost interest  but I ended up in a different field a rather interesting one.My friend who wanted to become an air hostess so bad decided to give up because of body weight issues something she would have worked on if she really was determined.</p>
			<p>The first step in visualizing beyond our experience and current situation is to discover what we really want.A predator will stop at nothing until it gets its prey.This step brings motivation and zeal to work for what we want.When we identify what we really want we will always find opportunity that will lead you to accomplish the goal.I am always marvelled at how when you promise a kid a gift in return for good grade,he/she will work hard and deliver with this same same kind of determination we should be inspired to set our goals and work on them.</p>
			<p>The second step is to remove any doubt that we may have towards achieving what we have set.Most unfulfilled goals are due to lack of confidence and self doubt.Most people let the situation they are going through or have gone through in the past dictate their life,for some lack of finances is a huge barrier towards achieving what they want.People should realize that doors open naturally for go-getters no matter their situation.Confiidence is another important tool that cannot be bought but rather caltivated.Hanging out with the right crew and standing up for what someone believes in is another way of building confidence.</p>
			<p>The third step is having a mentor or a role model.Most succcesful people have gain motivation by people they look upto.I am always reminded of the famous words if you hangout with a millionaire and you shall become one.Like-minded people tend to support each other and pull each other to their level.Every story is an inspiration and a voice of hope to those who want to make a change in their lives and in the society</p>
			<p>The last step is to document all our achievement no matter how little they are.Progress is progress regardless of the quantity.Doing this boosts our pride and confidence level and also moitivates us to do more.If you reward someone for job well done,the person will always strive to their best.Little achievements always amount to bigger ones in future</p>
			<p>In conclusion for us to visualize beyond what we see and experience,we should believe in ourselves,let not what we are going through define us and be ready to work so as to achieve what we have set our minds on</p>
